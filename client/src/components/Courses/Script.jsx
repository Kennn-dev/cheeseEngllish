                    Would I like to live on a desert island? It's a great question. When I was younger, I used to really want to live on a desert island. I thought it would be one of the most fun things in the world, as long as I could take some good music and a great selection of books. I'm a massive reader, I love reading.

Even though I read an obscene amount of books, up to 15 or 20 books a month, some months, I just never seem to have as much time as I want to read the books that I want to read. I once calculated how many books have been published, how many books are being published every year. It would take more than a lifetime to read all the books I want to read because there's stuff to do in life as well. So I always thought I'd want to go and live on a desert island with all the books I could take with me and just read everyday and do sit ups and get healthy and get a nice suntan.

Now I'm a little older. A lot older, it's my birthday today. And I have a family and I have friends and things to do, and to be honest, it's still tempting, but I probably would... I would.
